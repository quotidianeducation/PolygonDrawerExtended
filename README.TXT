
PROJECT TITLE:Draw polygons dictated by mouse click and arrow key in BlueJ, centroids drawn and panel Points saved to a file and on run loaded from the file.

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Demonstration
VERSION or DATE: November 2024
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: main method
AUTHORS: Graham C Roberts
USER INSTRUCTIONS: In Windows, use the left mouse button clicked on the "canvas" to create a coordinate and thereafter the next coordinated to draw a line to and so draw an unclosed polygon. Start another by pressing an arrow key. When arrow key is pressed, the current polygon Points are printed to standard output.

NOTE: The extension program reads coordinate Points from a text file and draws them to complement the printed output to the terminal in the initial program. To complement this, on press of the space bar the Points are sent to the text file.  Centroids (the geometric centre of the polygon) are computed and shown on the panel as red circles.
